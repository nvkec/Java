/* There are Cows. A Cow has a name and can moo. When you ask a Cow to moo, it shouts out its name. Design a class for Cow and the
tester code. After testing if cows work correctly, create 2 references andthen point to same object. Verify what happens if you change the state
of the object using one ref when you invoke behaviour using the second.! */
