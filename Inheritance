/* A device has a name and can do something. TV, Printer and Microwave are devices. Using TV, you can watch movie; using Printer, you can 
print; using Microwave, you can cook (all these are doSomething() implementations - so override them in the respective classes).When a device
is made to dosomething, it shouts out its name as well. An Electrician is one who can test any device. When he is asked to test a device, he 
will make it do something and test it. A TV can switchChannel as well (delta functionality). So if a tv is given to be tested to an 
electrician, he will make the tv dosomething and switch channel as well. Write a tester class to test how devices, electricians work.
If Device has a private String name, do Printer, TV, etc subclasses have a name? If yes, how to access it in overridden doSomething() 
method? Try it out.
Follow these steps one by one to implement the above problem.

1) Frist build the Device.java class in source folder with the Device class definition.
